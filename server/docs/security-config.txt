## CORS AND COOKIE CONFIGURATION ##

### Cookies
- SameSite: 'none' - Required for cross-origin requests (frontend and backend on different domains)
- Secure: true - Enabled in production/staging (HTTPS only)
- HttpOnly: true - Prevents JavaScript access to cookies (XSS protection)
- Domain: Optional via COOKIE_DOMAIN env var (for subdomain sharing)
- MaxAge: 7 days for session tokens, 1 hour for access tokens

### CORS
- Origin: Configured via FRONTEND_ORIGIN env var
- Credentials: true - Allows cookies to be sent with cross-origin requests
- Security: Strict origin validation prevents unauthorized domains

### Additional Security
- Helmet.js: Security headers middleware
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- Cookie-parser: Enabled for cookie handling


### Notes
- Cookies are set with sameSite: 'none' since we are using different domains for frontend and backend
- CORS is configured with allowd origin of the frontend
- Even if the sameSite config is 'none' (allows cross-origin requests) the app secured with strict CORS configuration
